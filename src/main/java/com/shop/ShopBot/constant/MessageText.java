            BCH is a great crypto currency (CC) which is much much better than fiat money (like dollars or something).

            If you still don't have any BCH coins yet you can get it via @iqwalletbot
            which is a great crypto wallet with integrated exchange service!
            If you have got other CC, for example Bitcoin, Doge, ETH, etc.
            you can easily exchange it to BCH at https://bitni.com (no registration or other bullshit required).
            Just Copy & Paste the BCH address given by the @platibot at Load Wallet
            section and coins will come directly to your bot wallet.

            What can I sell? Is it legal?

            You don't actually sell, because crypto isn't real money. You just exchange your digital good for some tokens.
            Your good can be some information, password string, Steam game key, hidden link, check or card number, any text message or photo you can send to the bot and somebody need it.

            Of course do not try to sell something illegal like child porn or drugs. This is not a darknet or something. Respect the laws of the place you are in, otherwise you can be punished.
